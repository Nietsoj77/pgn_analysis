# Analyzing pgn files

Game files can be downloaded from https://database.lichess.org/ or via API (see https://lichess.org/api for details).

The workbook in this repo was created as my final project in the Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree.

I have made this available so that others can build on my work and hopefully improve it.
